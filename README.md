# Allo Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

Welcome to the official repo for the Allo Protocol design. This is where
protocol updates and new feature requests are discussed by the community of core
and ecosystem engineers.

The first version of Allo Protocol was designed and built by
[Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) as part of their efforts to decentralize and make
capital allocation patterns like Quadratic Funding easier to use and build with.
This repository is where the protocol team discusses updates and fixes to the
protocol and ways to make it better.

In this repository, you'll find all the active proposals to improve, modify, or
add to the functionality of the protocol.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome from anyone!

Before making a proposal, we ask that you start a thread in the
[Discussion](https://github.com/allo-protocol/aips/discussions/new/choose) on
this repository first.

If you plan to add a new AIP, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository by clicking the 'Fork' button in the top right
2. Clone and install the repository to your computer
3. Create a new AIP file under `/AIPS` following the [AIP
   Template](./template.md)
4. Submit a Pull Request to the `main` branch of this repository

All contributions are welcome and will be reviewed by a member of the team. The
core team reserves the right to close and dismiss any and all proposals though.
Whether or not we can entertain a proposal depends on our current roadmap and
priorities, as well as our capacity to take on and review protocol changes.
